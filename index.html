        <h2 > About me </h2>
        <p > Hi there! I’m Mitchelle Ngare, a sophomore currently pursuing Computer Science and Digital Art and a minor in Economics
             at Dartmouth College. My passion for technology and creativity fuels my work, and I am constantly exploring how these 
             fields intersect. With a background in coding and web design, I thrive on solving complex problems through innovative solutions. 
            I also enjoy delving into digital arts, focusing on character modeling and animation. My goal is to blend technical 
            expertise with artistic expression, building projects that are not only functional but visually compelling. 
            Thanks for visiting my portfolio—feel free to explore my work and get in touch!</p>

        <h2> Room Project</h2>
        <p>For my room project, I designed a clean modern house featuring big windows that 
            allow for ample natural light and create an open, airy atmosphere. The design emphasizes 
            simplicity and functionality, with sleek lines and minimalist decor. The key feature of the 
            design is the bold windows, which serve as both a functional and aesthetic element, offering 
            expansive views and enhancing the connection between the interior and exterior. </p>

        <p> The design choices for the house were inspired by a desire to create a serene and comfortable 
            living space that seamlessly blends with its natural surroundings</p>

        <h2>Abstract Project</h2>
        <p>This abstract design features concentric circles in a gradient of teal to blue, 
            creating a sense of depth and movement. The swirling pattern evokes the flow of 
            energy or time, drawing the viewer’s eye toward the center.</p>

        <h2>Biped Project</h2>
        <p>For my animation project, I designed a unique character that blends elements of a 
            robot and an alien, creating a paranormal-inspired creature. The character is 
            predominantly green, adding an otherworldly and eerie aesthetic to the animation.</p>
